# sfml-reliable-udp
A small and headers-only library for a reliable UDP client-server model with extensibility in mind.

This is a header only library, so it's only a #include or two into existing projects to use it.

Compiling this project will create a test binary; You can execute `sfml_reliable_udp server` to run it as a server or just `sfml_reliable_udp` to run it as a client.
